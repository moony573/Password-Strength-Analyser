🔐 Password Strength Analyzer

📌 Overview

This project is a Password Strength Analyzer built using Python. It evaluates the security level of a given password by checking multiple criteria such as length, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. The tool classifies passwords into categories like Weak, Moderate, or Strong, and also provides constructive feedback to help users create secure passwords.

The analyzer was implemented and tested as part of my project work. The design emphasizes modularity, simplicity, and accuracy, making it suitable for both beginners learning Python and real-world applications where password validation is essential.

🎯 Features

Checks for minimum password length.
Validates presence of uppercase and lowercase letters.
Ensures digits and special characters are included.
Categorizes passwords as Weak, Moderate, Strong.
Provides user-friendly feedback on missing requirements.

🛠️ Tools and Environment

Programming Language: Python
Editors Used: VS Code, Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: Standard Python functions (any(), isdigit(), isupper(), len()), optional use of re for advanced validation.


🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-strength-analyzer.git
cd password-strength-analyzer

Run the analyzer script:
python analyzer.py

Enter passwords when prompted to check their strength.

🧪 Example Usage

Enter your password: Pass1234  
Password Strength: Moderate  
Feedback: Add at least one special character to make your password stronger.  

📊 Testing

Weak password example: mypassword → Weak
Moderate password example: Pass1234 → Moderate
Strong password example: S@fep4ss123 → Strong

These results confirm that the analyzer successfully evaluates password complexity and provides useful guidance for improving security.

📌 Outcome

Through this project, I gained practical experience in implementing security-focused validation systems. The Password Strength Analyzer effectively demonstrates how simple rules can greatly enhance password hygiene and protect against common attacks like brute-force or dictionary attacks.

This tool can be extended further for enterprise-level applications, where stricter rules and integration with registration systems are required.
